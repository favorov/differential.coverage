We start it as a package just to easy install to R.

0.1 - initial version, nothing works yet
0.2 - we can: 
	prepare uniform intervals (noodles)
	calcutate the coverage for intervals & list of bed files
	generate a list of genes that are around (+-flanks) ranges from GRanges
0.3 - tabulated fisher added
0.4 - annotaion functions improved; roxygen documentation added
0.5 - annotation function fixed; names changed
0.6 - working annotation functions : 
	genes.with.TSS.covered.by.interval, genes.with.TSS.covered, closest.gene.start.by.interval
0.7 - CountCoverageOfNoodles returns sparse Matrix
