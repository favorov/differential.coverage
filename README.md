differential.coverage
=====================
differential.coverage R package

Differential coverage: 
Description: Differential Coverage: More or less random collection of
    interval-focused tools.  They all are to get bed file collection (e.g.
    MBD-MACS) and to know which intervals are deferentially covered, which
    genes are around, etc. 

		We are complement with DiffBind: they join intervals and look at			
		differential BAM coverage between two conditions for each joined interval, 	
		while we look for differential coverage by the intervals in some outer 
		(e.g. uniform) annotation.
